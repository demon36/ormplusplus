ORM todo:
enable using NULL
let loadMany take a limit parameter
use loadMany without taking Class as parameter
implement saveMany
use eloquent like where (decorator design pattern)
add order by
check if column exist before executing the query 
check database models are copy-able
assert condition fields are available at current model
assert column exists in result
retrieve only columns declared by user
check column types at retrieval and insertion
implement Model::createTable()
use const by ref where possible

when user tries to select where, he will have to type column name in snake case
any better practice to that ?

watch this notation:

	class CreateMigrationStatisticsTable extends Migration
	{
		public function up()
		{
			Schema::create('migration_statistics', function (Blueprint $table) {
				$table->increments('id');
				$table->integer('s3_migration_id')->unsigned()->index();

for the problem of trying to access this inside the declaration scope of the user model
without letting the user notice
instead of using macros
we might just call a static function in another class that is implemented in Model.h
that stores all model tables
once other advantage is that we can check if a specific model is already tied to a table

check if Poco::Nullable can be used ?

check that poco sessions are thread safe
check that poco sessions have connection pools
